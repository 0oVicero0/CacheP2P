**CacheP2P** is a highly distributed [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) platform based on [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) and runs only in the **browser**.

It is a javascript library that once included in the pages of a website, makes every new user a mirror of the webpage he has opened and allows it to serve it to all the other users that also are accessing the same website, so the website's server doesn't have to deliver that content to the users. Users can share the content between themselves, and even if the website crashes, all the content can remain online as long as there are users accessing it.
